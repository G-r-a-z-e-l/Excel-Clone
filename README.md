# Excel-Clone
It is my first attempt in making App with electron.

To run the app ---
(i). Clone/download all the files into your system.
(ii). Open the folder in your editor.
(ii). Install nodejs.
(iii). Change the path to the folder in which all the files are present. 
(iv). npm install electron --save-dev (for windows) and npm install --save-dev electron(for linux/macos).
(v). Run npm start in the current folder.(or npm electron . )if start doesn't work.
Voila the app should open.


It is a basic clone with basic formulas like (A + B), (A - B), (A * C) and (A / B).
